INSTALL
=======
 To make use of this overlay procedure you will need to modify the VDI broker 
 web-app.
 
 The broker web-app runs within a Tomcat application server on the VDI 
 connection server. On a default install this web-app can be found under: 
 
   c -> Program Files -> VMWare -> VMWare View -> Server -> broker -> webapps
 
 The web-app itself is contained in the ROOT.war file.
 
 
 NOTE: You will need to copy the ROOT.war file somewhere else to modify and 
       rebuild it. (ex: users directory) 
   
  **** It is highly advisable to save a copy of this UNALTERED war ****
  **** file somewhere also.                                        ****
 
 Create a place to work: mkdir tmp_portal. Place your copy of ROOT.war in your 
 tmp_portal directory.

 Expand the ROOT.war file, [jar -xvf ROOT.war]. You will have a tree that looks
 like this with ROOT.war being the file you extracted.
 
 
 tmp_portal 
  |___ broker
  |___ favicon.ico
  |___ help
  |___ portlets
  |___ ROOT.war 
  |___ styles
  |___ WEB-INF
 

 Next add our jar to the web-app. 
 
 1) copy the jar you created previously into the WEB-INF/lib directory.
 
 2) define and call our servlet from WEB-INF/web.xml  
 
    o add this block of XML to define the servlet somewhere around line 320
 
   <servlet>
     <servlet-name>org.extreme.pppoverlay_PortalOverlayServlet</servlet-name>
     <servlet-class>org.extreme.pppoverlay.PortalOverlayServlet</servlet-class>
   </servlet> 
 
    o add this block of XML to reference our new servlet somewhere around 
      line 691
 
   <servlet-mapping>
     <servlet-name>org.extreme.pppoverlay_PortalOverlayServlet</servlet-name>
     <url-pattern>/portlets/client/*</url-pattern>
     <url-pattern>/styles/clientlaunch-default/*</url-pattern>
   </servlet-mapping>
 
 3) comment other /portal, /style calls out 
 
    o This is the tricky part but, basically you want to place comment 
      ( example: <!-- bla --> ) markers around the parts/pages you don't want
      the web-app to use any longer. I give an example listing below. 
      
      . Line 341 to 408 can comment out
      . line 611 to 691 can comment out
 
 4) now repackage ROOT.war incorporating your changes
 
    o from your tmp_portal directory issue the following command
 
      #> jar -cvf ROOT.war broker favicon.ico help portlets styles WEB-INF
 
 5) copy back to server and restart your "VMWare View Web Component" service.
    
    o Stop the "VMWare View Web Component" service 
    o Remove ROOT.war and the ROOT directory from 
     c -> Program Files -> VMWare -> VMWare View -> Server -> broker -> webapps
    o Place your NEW ROOT.war file in the above directory
    o Start the "VMWare View Web Component" service
